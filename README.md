on clicking admin we will be asked for password, this information will further get stored into a txt file along with login date and time. If we choose passenger it will give us options like view plane details with their prices according to class(economy,first and business), book a seat, cancel a seat and view our filled details. On booking a seat after all formalities we have two payment options which are manually and another one is online in this your seat price is displayed and after further procedure an otp is sent to your email after checking otp it proceeds and books a seat for us. Though, there are many limitations to this projects.</div>
